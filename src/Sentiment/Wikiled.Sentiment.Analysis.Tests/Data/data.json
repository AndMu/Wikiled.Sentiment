      "Text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boston Celtics All-Star forward Paul Pierce and Orlando Magic coach Stan Van Gundy were fined by the NBA for separate incidents that occurred earlier this week, the league said on Saturday.  Boston Celtics' head coach Doc Rivers (L) talks to forward Paul Pierce during the fourth quarter of their NBA basketball game against the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis December 28, 2010. REUTERS/Brent SmithPierce was fined $15,000 for tossing an object into the stands during a road game against the Indiana Pacers and Van Gundy was fined $35,000 for comments he made about officials following the team’s recent victory over the New York Knicks.  After Orlando’s Dwight Howard picked up his league-leading 12th technical foul during a 112-103 win over New York on December 30, Van Gundy said his All-Star center was being singled out by game officials for his words and actions on the court.  “I could probably give you 20 guys who are a lot harder on officials than he is. Why he’s been the guy to get all the technical’s, I don’t know,” Van Gundy said after the game.  “But there are a lot of guys around the league who are a lot harder on officials, yell at them, swear and everything else and get away with it.”  According to NBA rules, Howard will be suspended for one game if he gets 16 technical fouls and an additional game for every two technical fouls after that.  Before the season began, the NBA said they would enforce stricter rules for technical fouls in a bid to clean up the game’s image on the court.  Referees were instructed to call a technical foul for actions such as aggressive gestures like air punches, demonstrative disagreement and questioning a call excessively.  Pierce’s incident occurred early in the opening quarter of the Celtics’ 95-83 win over the Pacers on December 28 at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  He led all players in the game with 21 points and seven assists, including 10 points during a two-minute span of the second quarter that cut Indiana’s led to 39-35.

      "Text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A mystery airplane prompted an evacuation of the Capitol building and scrambling of military fighter jets on Saturday but authorities said the false alarm was caused by a commercial airliner briefly losing radio contact.  A Federal Aviation Administration official said a Piedmont Airlines plane in the Washington, D.C. area briefly lost radio contact and military planes took off to find it.  “Shortly after that we reestablished contact with the plane, and it has been on the ground at (Reagan National Airport) for a while. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials are interviewing the pilots,” FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said.  NBC news reported that the Capitol building was evacuated for a short time. Most members of Congress and their staffs do not return to Washington until next week.  Since the September 11, 2001 suicide attack on the Pentagon in Washington, U.S. authorities consider any unidentified airplane approaching the Washington area as a threat and scramble fighters.

      "Text": "* Officers in riot gear protect fire engines   * Guards’ union says riot highlights risk of spending cuts   * Minister condemns disturbance, says inquiry to be held  (Adds prison minister’s comments, paragraphs 6-9)   By Paul Hackett   ARUNDEL, England, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Rioting prisoners torched buildings at a low-security British jail on Saturday, an incident the prison guards’ union said highlighted the risks of government plans to slash spending on the justice system.   About 40 prisoners took part in rioting at Ford men’s prison near Arundel, southern England, that began around midnight on New Year’s Eve, the Prison Service said.   Prisoners smashed windows and started fires, forcing staff to retreat. Twelve hours after the trouble began, prisoners set fire to an accommodation block and firefighters needed the protection of scores of prison officers in riot gear to enter the prison to put out the blaze.   Television pictures showed the gutted shells of several other recreation buildings.   Around 140 extra prison guards were brought in to quell the trouble and, by evening, authorities appeared to have the situation under control.   Prisons minister Crispin Blunt said the riot began when guards tried to breathalyse prisoners suspected of drinking alcohol smuggled into the jail.   He said the riot was “outrageous” and unprecedented at a low-security prison where inmates are trusted to behave well.   Around 150 inmates — both those suspected of involvement in the trouble and those whose accommodation had been burned down — were being transferred to higher-security prisons, he said.   Prisoners who took part in the riot faced serving the rest of their sentences in higher-security jails or being denied early release, he told the BBC.   Inmates of Ford, a sprawling rural complex of huts housing several hundred prisoners, are not generally confined to individual cells and may work outside.   Mark Freeman, deputy general secretary of the Prison Officers’ Association, sought to link the incident to public spending cuts that Britain’s coalition government has embarked on to cut a budget deficit of 10 percent of national output.   “We understand management have been trying to reduce the amount of prison officers working here (at Ford) and I think that this should be a stark reminder of just how dangerous even open-prison condition prisoners can be,” he told Sky News.
